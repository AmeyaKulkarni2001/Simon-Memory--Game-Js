# Simon-Memory-Game-JQuery

In real life Simon is a 2 player memory game in which player1 chooses a pattern and player2 follow the pattern and if he gets its wrong the game is over.<br>
So, to adapt it into JQuery, we first generate a random number series which only contains number between 0-3<br>
We use these numbers to select from a array of colors which contain red yellow blue green<br>
Once we get thses colors, we generate a pattern<br>
this pattern is stored and then showed to the user turn by turn<br>
it is to be copied by the user, which is stored in another array<br>
We increase the level of the user the forward he moves<br>
If the user gets the pattern wrong the level and pattern are re-setted and the user has to start from the beginning
